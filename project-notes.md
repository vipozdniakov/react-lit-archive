## ‚úÖ Update: Google Authentication Issue Resolved (2025-04-28)

- Firebase Authentication through Google Sign-In is now fully functional in both local development (`localhost:5173`) and production (`https://react-lit-archive.vercel.app`).
- OAuth 2.0 Client settings updated:
  - Authorized JavaScript Origins and Redirect URIs configured for all active domains.
- API Key restrictions updated:
  - Allowed `localhost`, `localhost:5173`, `my-lit-archive.firebaseapp.com`, and `react-lit-archive.vercel.app`.
- Slight warning about `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and occasional `403 Forbidden` in console from `getProjectConfig` API is **non-critical**:
  - Login flow is not affected.
  - No user-visible errors occur.

Project successfully restored and secured after key compromise cleanup.
