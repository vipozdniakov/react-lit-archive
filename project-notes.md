## üìã Roadmap / Future Ideas

- [ ] Add strict vs. loose tag filtering toggle (`every()` vs. `some()`)
- [ ] Display a helpful message when no posts match active tag filters
- [ ] Place filtering mode toggle above the tag cloud, ideally below the search bar
- [ ] Revisit tag structure (language, genre, series, mood) if multi-category filtering is needed
- [ ] Implement inline editing of posts without switching to a separate form
- [ ] Add multilingual UI (RU / BY / PL interface)
- [ ] Enhance sorting options (tags, dates, popularity)
- [ ] Implement dark mode support
- [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Add basic statistics panel for admin (number of posts, views)
- [ ] Advanced sorting of posts by tags and publication dates
- [ ] Code optimization and components refactoring for better performance
- [ ] Further strengthening of security measures and server-side validation
- [ ] Detect `#series` tag and sort such posts from oldest to newest
- [ ] Add mini-book view for series:
  - [ ] Full-screen reading mode with chapter swiping
  - [ ] Downward swipe or button to exit
  - [ ] Reserve upward swipe for future use (e.g., bookmarks or settings)
  - [ ] Chapter thumbnails and carousel of recommended posts
